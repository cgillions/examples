# Examples

This repository contains 3 examples of Ansible projects that increase in complexity.

1. [playbook_basic](/tree/master/playbook_basic)
   This project lists tasks in the playbook file

2. [playbook_role](/tree/master/playbook_role)
   This project uses a role to encapsulate the tasks

3. [playbook_role_structure](/tree/master/playbook_role_structure)
   This project makes use of the role directory structure for a more advanced deployment
